# Higgsfield Marketplace Cards

Higgsfield keeps the marketplace rules and templates on its side, plans each card and renders it. The guard plans the set first with Higgsfield's free `--enhance-only` step and prices every planned image before anything is made.

## What it costs

Scopes differ a lot in size: `main` is 1 image, `product-images` is 6, `aplus` is 8 and `full-set` is 13. Each card is one image job (Higgsfield's guide says `nano_banana_2`, quoted at 2 credits on 2026-10-12), so a full set is roughly 26 credits or more. Always price the scope with `--dry` and start with `main`.

```
node ../higgsfield-studio/scripts/hf.mjs cards --scope main --prompt "sparkling peach lemonade can" --image can.png --dry
```

## Before anything else

```
sh ../higgsfield-studio/scripts/setup-deps.sh --check
node ../higgsfield-studio/scripts/hf.mjs check
```

The first checks Node and the `higgsfield` tool, and `sh ../higgsfield-studio/scripts/setup-deps.sh` installs what is missing after asking. The second checks the sign-in. If Higgsfield is not signed in, the user signs in once with `higgsfield auth login`, which opens the browser. Never print the sign-in token or open the CLI's credential file.

## Spending credits

This skill is part of the Higgsfield Studio plugin. Every paid command runs through the main skill's guard, `node ../higgsfield-studio/scripts/hf.mjs`. It asks Higgsfield for the price before running, refuses above `--max` or below the reserve, never pays twice for the same request, and writes what each job really cost to `.higgsfield/ledger.jsonl` in the project. The full rules are in `../higgsfield-studio/SKILL.md`. The short form:

- Price first with `--dry`, using every parameter the real job will use. Tell the user the total for anything over about 5 credits.
- Put `--max N` (a little above the price), `--tag` and `--why "..."` on every paid job.
- Ask before spending more than about 10 credits, or 10% of what is left. `node ../higgsfield-studio/scripts/hf.mjs account` shows the balance.
- Anything outward or not undoable goes through `act` and needs `--yes`. Say what will happen and wait for the user's yes before adding it.
- Report in plain words, in the user's language: where the file is, what it cost, what is left. No JSON or job ids unless asked.

Free commands, such as lists, `model get`, presets and uploads, can run as `node ../higgsfield-studio/scripts/hf.mjs run <command>` or as `higgsfield <command>` directly.

## Updates

This skill is versioned with its plugin. Its version is `metadata.version` in the header of this file. The plugin's history, for every skill in it, is in `../higgsfield-studio/CHANGELOG.md`. To check for a newer version, open the address on its `Latest:` line and compare the top version with this one. Read every entry in between and tell the user what changed before anything is updated.
