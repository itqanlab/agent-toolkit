description: "Connect a Cloudflare account once, then manage DNS records, subdomains, Pages sites, R2 buckets and Workers from the agent without opening the dashboard again. Setup is a two-minute guided flow that needs three checkboxes, not the 390-odd permissions Cloudflare would otherwise ask you to pick by hand. Works on macOS, Windows and Linux. Triggers: 'connect my Cloudflare', 'add a subdomain', 'point a domain at my server', 'create a DNS record', 'set up Cloudflare Pages', 'add a custom domain to Pages', 'create an R2 bucket', 'check if DNS has propagated', 'list my domains', 'deploy this worker', 'publish my site', 'cloudflare'."

compatibility: "Requires Node 18 or newer — run scripts/setup-deps.sh (or scripts/setup-deps.ps1 on Windows) to check for it and install it if missing. Needs network access to the Cloudflare API. Deploying a site to Pages or a Worker additionally uses wrangler, which is fetched on demand through npx and needs no separate install or login."

# Cloudflare

Everything here runs through two scripts. `scripts/setup.mjs` connects an account; `scripts/cf.mjs` does the work.

## Who you are doing this for

Assume the person asking has never opened a terminal. **You run the commands; they never do.** They are asked to do exactly two things by hand, and only because neither can be done for them: tick three boxes on a web page, and paste the resulting value into a file so it never passes through the conversation.

Everything else — checking what exists, adding the record, waiting for it to resolve, confirming it worked — is yours. Report it in plain words. "app.example.com now points at your server, and the world can see it" is the result they asked for; the record id is not.

If they are clearly comfortable with a terminal, stop narrating and let them drive.

## Before anything else: check the dependencies

These scripts need Node 18 or newer. Check first, so a missing dependency does not surface as a confusing failure halfway through a setup:

```
sh scripts/setup-deps.sh --check
```

Non-zero exit means missing or too old. `sh scripts/setup-deps.sh` (Windows: `.\scripts\setup-deps.ps1`) prints the right install command for that machine and asks before running it; `--yes` skips the question. Where there is no package manager it gives instructions the person can follow, including one that needs no admin rights.

## Connect an account first

Every command needs a saved credential. Check before doing anything else:

```
node scripts/setup.mjs status
```

If it reports that Cloudflare is not connected, run the guided setup and follow what it prints:

```
node scripts/setup.mjs begin
```

It writes an empty file, tells the user exactly which three permission rows to tick in the Cloudflare dashboard, and stops. **Never ask for the token in the conversation** — the user pastes it into the file the script names. When they say they are done:

```
node scripts/setup.mjs finish
```

That builds the real credential from the temporary one, saves it, deletes the temporary one, and confirms which account is connected. Re-running `begin` when already connected does nothing; add `--force` to replace a saved credential.

Why two steps: Cloudflare has no "grant everything" control, and a token built by hand means choosing from hundreds of permissions. A token that can manage tokens can create the full one, so the user ticks three boxes and the script does the rest.

The credential that results can do everything **except create more tokens** — Cloudflare refuses to grant that to a token made by another token. Rotating means running `begin --force` and making a fresh temporary token.

## Commands

```
node scripts/cf.mjs whoami                  which account is connected
node scripts/cf.mjs zones                   every domain on the account
node scripts/cf.mjs dns <domain>            all records for a domain
node scripts/cf.mjs dns-add <name> <type> <content> [--proxied] [--ttl 300]
node scripts/cf.mjs dns-remove <name> [--type A] --yes
node scripts/cf.mjs check <hostname>        what public resolvers currently return
node scripts/cf.mjs r2                      R2 buckets
```

Pages, start to finish:

```
node scripts/cf.mjs pages                            projects and their domains
node scripts/cf.mjs pages-create <project> [--branch main]
node scripts/cf.mjs pages-deploy <project> <dir>     upload a built directory
node scripts/cf.mjs pages-domain <project> <hostname> attach a domain, DNS included
node scripts/cf.mjs pages-domains <project>          domains and certificate status
```

Workers:

```
node scripts/cf.mjs workers                          scripts and the hostnames they answer on
node scripts/cf.mjs worker-deploy <dir>              upload the Worker configured in that directory
node scripts/cf.mjs worker-domain <name> <hostname>  route a hostname to it
node scripts/cf.mjs worker-domains                   every Worker hostname on the account
```

`worker-deploy` needs a `wrangler.toml` (or `.json`) in the directory naming the Worker and its entry file; it says so plainly if there is none. On an account that has never used Workers it stops first and explains the `workers.dev` subdomain problem, which otherwise fails with an error that only offers a dashboard link.

Unlike Pages, **do not create a DNS record for a Worker hostname** — `worker-domain` is enough, and Cloudflare manages the record and certificate itself.

`dns-add` and `pages-domain` take the full hostname — `app.example.com`, not `app`. The zone is worked out from it, so nothing needs a zone id.

`pages-deploy` is the one command that shells out. Uploading files is not something the API can do for us, so it runs Cloudflare's own tool through `npx` — nothing to install, and the saved credential is passed to it, so there is no second login.

`pages-domain` does two things on purpose: attaches the domain to the project **and** creates the DNS record. Doing only one leaves the domain stuck at "pending" forever, which is the most common way this goes wrong. It replaces any existing record for that hostname, and always creates it proxied, because Cloudflare has to be in the request path to serve a Pages site and its certificate.

Anything not covered by a command is a direct API call; `references/playbooks.md` shows the pattern.

## Before changing anything

**Show the current state first.** Run `dns <domain>` and show the user the records that matter before adding or replacing one. A wrong DNS record takes a site off the internet, and the person asking may not know what the existing records do.

**Deleting requires confirmation.** `dns-remove` lists what matches and refuses to act without `--yes`. Show that list to the user and get an explicit yes before re-running with the flag. Never pass `--yes` on the first attempt.

**Proxied or not is a real decision, not a default.** Proxied (orange cloud) routes traffic through Cloudflare, hides the origin address and provides a certificate. DNS-only points straight at the server. A host that terminates its own TLS, or any non-HTTP service, needs DNS-only — proxying it will break it. If it is not obvious which is wanted, ask.

## Playbooks

`references/playbooks.md` has the step-by-step sequences, including the parts that are not Cloudflare API calls:

- point a subdomain at a server, and wait for the certificate
- deploy a Pages site and attach a custom domain
- deploy a Worker on your own domain
- create an R2 bucket and connect it to a public hostname
- move a domain between servers with no downtime
- work out why a hostname is not resolving

## What this cannot do

Building is the caller's job. `pages-deploy` and `worker-deploy` upload what is already there; run whatever build the project uses first, then point at its output.

Everything else on this account — DNS, subdomains, Pages, Workers, R2, zones — works through these scripts.

## Failure messages

Errors are rewritten for people who do not know Cloudflare's error codes. A refused call explains that a permission is probably missing and gives the command to fix it; an unrecognised credential says it may have been deleted, and how to replace it. Keep that habit for anything added here: say what happened, then what to do next.
