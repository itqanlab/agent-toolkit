compatibility: Runs on macOS and Linux — both scripts are bash. On Windows use WSL or Git Bash; there is no native PowerShell path. Requires ffmpeg, and yt-dlp for URL sources; run scripts/setup.sh to check for either (--check) or install them (--yes). An optional local whisper engine (free, offline) adds transcripts for sources with no captions. Needs network access for remote videos.

# watch-video

Let the agent "watch" a video by turning it into a transcript plus frames it can Read.

## When to use
- Someone shares a video URL or a local file and wants it watched, analyzed, summarized, or reverse-engineered — hook, pacing, on-screen text, editing style, format.
- You need the visual or spoken content of a video, not just its metadata.
- Also works on audio-only sources, in which case you get a transcript and no frames.

## Setup

Check and install what this skill needs:

```
bash scripts/setup.sh --check          # report only, installs nothing
bash scripts/setup.sh                  # shows a plan, asks, then installs
bash scripts/setup.sh --yes            # non-interactive, for agent use
bash scripts/setup.sh --with-whisper   # add free offline speech-to-text
```

It detects the platform and package manager (Homebrew, apt, dnf, pacman, zypper, apk, pipx/pip) and prints every command before running it. Nothing installs without a confirmation or an explicit `--yes`.

If a dependency is missing when you run the main script, it will point you here.

## How to use

1. Run the script. It prints a manifest with the transcript path and frame paths:
   ```
   bash scripts/watch.sh "<url-or-path>" [options]
   ```
2. **Read the transcript** — the `.srt` path in the manifest, if present.
3. **Read the frames** in order (`frame_001.jpg`, `frame_002.jpg`, …) — the visual track.
4. Synthesize: answer the question, or describe the hook (first ~1s), pacing and cuts, on-screen text, format (letterbox vs full-bleed), branding, and anything notable.

### Options

| Option | Default | What it does |
| :-- | :-- | :-- |
| `--frames N` | 30 (max 60) | Target frame count |
| `--width W` | 480 | Frame width in px |
| `--start SEC` / `--end SEC` | — | Sample a time range only |
| `--lang CODE` | `en.*` | Caption language, e.g. `ar.*`, `all` |
| `--scenes` | off | One frame per visual cut |
| `--no-whisper` | off | Skip local transcription even if an engine is installed |
| `--whisper-model M` | `base` | Speed vs accuracy, e.g. `large-v3` |
| `--yes` | off | Accept prompts, including installing a transcriber |
| `--cookies BROWSER` | — | Login-gated videos, e.g. `chrome` |
| `--playlist N` | single | Allow a playlist, take first N |
| `--outdir DIR` | temp | Where output lands |
| `--keep-video` | off | Keep the download |

## Choosing options

**Short clips (under 60s).** The default 30 frames is roughly one every 1–2s. Plenty.

**Long videos.** Raise `--frames`, or better, use `--start`/`--end` to sample the section that matters. The whole file downloads before framing, so narrowing the range does not skip the download but does keep the frame count meaningful.

**Edited video with cuts.** `--scenes` gives one frame per visual cut, so you see the shots that actually exist rather than arbitrary samples across them. It falls back to even sampling automatically when a source has too few cuts to be useful, such as a static screencast or a single-shot talking head.

**No captions.** Many sources ship none. The script then looks for captions in any language, and if there are still none it transcribes locally — automatically, whenever a whisper engine is installed. Installing one is the opt-in; `--no-whisper` skips it, and `--whisper-model large-v3` trades speed for accuracy.

**Login-gated or age-restricted.** `--cookies chrome` reuses a browser session you are already signed into. Only use it on accounts and content you have access to.

**Comparing several videos.** Run once per URL into separate `--outdir` directories, then read across the frame sets.

## What it accepts

Any source yt-dlp supports — 1750+ sites including YouTube, TikTok, Instagram, X, Facebook, Vimeo, Reddit, Twitch, Dailymotion, Bilibili, SoundCloud and LinkedIn — plus direct media URLs and local files. Audio-only sources return a transcript with no frames.

## Notes
- Reads publicly accessible media. It does not bypass paywalls or DRM. `--cookies` reuses your own session; it does not defeat access control.
- A playlist URL downloads a single video unless you pass `--playlist N`.
- Downloaded video is deleted after framing unless you pass `--keep-video`. Frames and transcript remain.
- If a source that used to work stops downloading, the usual cause is an out-of-date yt-dlp. `scripts/setup.sh` will update it.
