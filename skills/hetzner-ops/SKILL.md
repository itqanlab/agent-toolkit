description: "Connect one or more Hetzner Cloud projects once, then run the servers from the agent — list them, create, start, stop, resize, delete, manage SSH keys, firewalls, volumes, private networks, DNS zones and records, and see what the project is costing — without opening the console again. Setup adopts a token the machine already has, or walks through making one in about a minute. Several projects are kept apart by name, so a change cannot land on the wrong one by accident. Works on macOS, Windows and Linux. Triggers: 'connect my Hetzner', 'list my servers', 'create a server', 'reboot the server', 'resize my server', 'how much is this server costing', 'add an SSH key', 'what is my server's IP', 'is the server up', 'delete this server', 'add a DNS record on Hetzner', 'show my Hetzner projects', 'hetzner'."

Endpoint lookup downloads Hetzner's API description once (about 3 MB) and caches it. Covers Hetzner Cloud only — dedicated servers and storage boxes are a different service with separate credentials."

# Hetzner Cloud

Three scripts. `scripts/setup.mjs` connects projects, `scripts/hz.mjs` does the work, and `scripts/api.mjs` looks up any endpoint the others do not wrap.

## Who you are doing this for

Assume the person asking has never opened a terminal. **You run the commands; they never do.** They are asked to do exactly two things by hand, and only because neither can be done for them: create a token on a web page, and paste it into a file so it never passes through the conversation.

Everything else — checking what exists, making the change, waiting for it to finish, confirming it worked — is yours. Report it in plain words. "The server is back up at 203.0.113.10" is the result they asked for; the action id is not.

If they are clearly comfortable with a terminal, stop narrating and let them drive.

## Before anything else: check the dependencies

These scripts need Node 18 or newer. Check first, so a missing dependency does not surface as a confusing failure halfway through a setup:

```
sh scripts/setup-deps.sh --check
```

Non-zero exit means missing or too old. `sh scripts/setup-deps.sh` (Windows: `.\scripts\setup-deps.ps1`) prints the right install command for that machine and asks before running it; `--yes` skips the question.

## Connect a project first

```
node scripts/setup.mjs status
```

If nothing is connected, **look before asking for anything**. Many machines already have a Hetzner token configured for some other tool, and sending someone to make a second one is wasted effort and a second secret to look after:

```
node scripts/setup.mjs import          shows what was found, changes nothing
node scripts/setup.mjs import --yes    adopts it
```

The originals are left where they are and keep working.

If there is nothing to adopt, run the guided setup and follow what it prints:

```
node scripts/setup.mjs add <a-name-for-it>
node scripts/setup.mjs verify <that-name>
```

`add` writes the empty file, names it, and explains where in the Hetzner console to make the token. **Never ask for the token in the conversation** — the user pastes it into the file the script names. `verify` then checks it and reports whether it can make changes or only read.

### Why the name matters

**A Hetzner token belongs to one project, and Hetzner will not tell you which one.** There is no "who am I" call. The name given at setup is the only label that exists, so choose one the user will recognise — the project's name in the console is the obvious choice.

Every command that changes something prints that name. Do not remove that.

```
node scripts/setup.mjs status            every project, and whether its token still works
node scripts/setup.mjs use <name>        make one the default
node scripts/setup.mjs rename <old> <new>
node scripts/setup.mjs forget <name> --yes
```

Any command runs against another project with `--project <name>`:

```
node scripts/hz.mjs --project staging servers
```

With several projects configured and no default set, commands refuse to run rather than guess.

### Read or Read & Write

Hetzner asks this once, when the token is made, and it cannot be changed afterwards. A read-only token lists things and fails on every change. `verify` says which kind was pasted, so this is caught at setup instead of halfway through a deployment.

## Commands

```
node scripts/hz.mjs whoami                  which project is selected, and its size
node scripts/hz.mjs servers                 every server: status, address, type, price
node scripts/hz.mjs server <name>           one server in full
node scripts/hz.mjs costs                   what this project costs per month
node scripts/hz.mjs metrics <name> [--type cpu|disk|network] [--hours 6]
```

Running servers:

```
node scripts/hz.mjs create <name> --type cx22 --location hel1 [--image ubuntu-24.04] [--ssh-key <name>]
node scripts/hz.mjs power-on <name>
node scripts/hz.mjs shutdown <name>         asks the operating system to stop, cleanly
node scripts/hz.mjs power-off <name> --yes  cuts the power — see below
node scripts/hz.mjs reboot <name>
node scripts/hz.mjs resize <name> <type> [--upgrade-disk] --yes
node scripts/hz.mjs delete <name> --yes
```

Everything else in the project:

```
node scripts/hz.mjs ssh-keys
node scripts/hz.mjs ssh-key-add <name> <path-to-public-key>
node scripts/hz.mjs firewalls
node scripts/hz.mjs volumes
node scripts/hz.mjs networks
node scripts/hz.mjs load-balancers
node scripts/hz.mjs snapshots
node scripts/hz.mjs types [--location hel1]   sizes and prices where you are building
node scripts/hz.mjs locations
node scripts/hz.mjs images
```

DNS, when the domain's zone is hosted at Hetzner:

```
node scripts/hz.mjs zones
node scripts/hz.mjs dns <domain>
node scripts/hz.mjs dns-add <hostname> <type> <value> [--ttl 300] [--append]
node scripts/hz.mjs dns-remove <hostname> --type A --yes
node scripts/hz.mjs check <hostname>          what public resolvers currently return
```

## Things that are easy to get wrong

**`shutdown` and `power-off` are not the same.** `shutdown` asks the operating system to stop and lets it close its files. `power-off` cuts the power like pulling the cable, and anything not yet written to disk is lost. Prefer `shutdown`. `power-off` refuses to run without `--yes` and explains the difference first.

**A stopped server still costs money.** Hetzner bills for the server existing, not for it running. If someone stops a server to save money, tell them plainly that it does not, and that deleting is what stops the billing.

**`--upgrade-disk` cannot be undone.** Growing the disk during a resize is permanent, and a server with a grown disk can never move to a smaller type again. Without the flag the disk is left alone and the change is reversible. Do not add it unless the user has asked for more disk specifically.

**Creating a server without an SSH key is a security decision.** Hetzner then sets a root password and the machine accepts password logins from its first second alive. `create` refuses that path unless `--no-ssh-key` is passed, and when it happens the password is written into the credential file rather than printed, so it does not end up in a transcript.

**Names are unique per project, not globally.** Two projects can both have a `web-01`, and `--project` is the only thing keeping them apart.

**Most changes are asynchronous.** Hetzner answers with an action that is still running. Every command here waits for it to finish before reporting, so a message from these scripts means the change is done, not merely accepted.

## Before changing anything

**Show the current state first.** Run `servers` or `server <name>` and show the user what is there before creating, resizing or deleting. Say which project it is in.

**Deleting and power-cutting require confirmation.** `delete`, `power-off` and `dns-remove` print what they matched and refuse to act without `--yes`. Show that to the user and get an explicit yes before re-running with the flag. Never pass `--yes` on the first attempt.

**Check the price before creating.** `types --location <where>` lists what is available and what it costs. Server types differ by location, and one that exists in one place may not exist in another.

## Anything not wrapped above

The commands cover the everyday work. `request()` from `scripts/hz.mjs` reaches every endpoint with the same token, so the only real question is which endpoint and what it wants.

**Do not guess that.** Look it up:

```
node scripts/api.mjs search load balancer service
node scripts/api.mjs show <path> <method>
```

Then:

```js
import { request, waitForAction, findServer } from './scripts/hz.mjs';

const server = await findServer('web-01');
const { action } = await request(`/servers/${server.id}/actions/enable_backup`, { method: 'POST' });
await waitForAction(action, { label: 'turning on backups' });
```

`waitForAction` is not optional decoration — an action that is returned is not an action that has happened.

`references/playbooks.md` shows the same pattern in context.

## What this cannot do

Hetzner Cloud only. Dedicated servers, storage boxes and the older Robot service are a different product with different credentials, and none of them are reachable from here.

It also does not configure anything **inside** a server. Creating the machine is where this stops; installing software on it is a job for a shell session or a deployment tool.

## Failure messages

Errors are rewritten for people who do not know Hetzner's error codes. A refused change explains that the token is probably read-only and how to replace it; a sold-out server type says to try another location rather than repeating the request. Keep that habit for anything added here: say what happened, then what to do next.
